### **True/False Questions**  

16. **Static testing** can find defects early without running the software.  
   **Answer:** True  

17. The main objective of software testing is to **prove the software is defect-free**.  
   **Answer:** False  

18. **Debugging** and **testing** are the same process.  
   **Answer:** False  

19. If a defect is found later in the development cycle, it is generally **more expensive to fix**.  
   **Answer:** True  

20. The **absence-of-defects fallacy** states that a system with no found defects is always useful.  
   **Answer:** False  

21. **Exhaustive testing** is possible for complex software applications.  
   **Answer:** False  

22. Dynamic testing is performed **after** the software is executed.  
   **Answer:** True  

23. Testers should prioritize testing efforts based on **risk and criticality** of software components.  
   **Answer:** True  

24. **Verification** is about checking if the software meets user expectations.  
   **Answer:** False (it checks against requirements)  

25. The goal of software testing is to eliminate **all** system failures.  
   **Answer:** False  

26. **White-box testing** involves checking the software’s internal structure and logic.  
   **Answer:** True  

27. Testing can be **fully automated**, eliminating the need for human testers.  
   **Answer:** False  

28. **Defects tend to be concentrated in certain areas of the system** rather than being evenly distributed.  
   **Answer:** True  

29. **Regression testing** ensures that new code changes do not introduce new defects.
